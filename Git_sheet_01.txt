# GIT CHEAT SHEET

Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub 
related that happens locally on your computer. This cheat sheet features the most important and commonly 
used Git commands for easy reference





## INSTALLATION & GUIS
# GitHub provides platform-specific installers for Git, along with a graphical user interface.
# GitHub for Windows: https://windows.github.com
# GitHub for Mac: https://mac.github.com
# For Linux and Solaris platforms, the latest release is available on the official Git website: http://git-scm.com





## SETUP
# Configuring user information used across all local repositories
# Set a name that is identifiable for credit when reviewing version history
git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"

# Set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
git config --global user.email "[valid-email]"

# Set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
git config --global color.ui auto





## SETUP & INIT
# Configuring user information, initializing, and cloning repositories
# Initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
git init

# Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
git clone [url]





## STAGE & SNAPSHOT
# Working with snapshots and the Git staging area
# Show modified files in the working directory, staged for the next commit
git status

# Add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
git add [file]

# Unstage a file while retaining the changes in the working directory
git reset [file]

# Diff of what is changed but not staged
git diff

# Diff of what is staged but not yet committed
git diff --staged

# Commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
git commit -m "[descriptive message]"






## BRANCH & MERGE
# Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes
# List your branches, a * will appear next to the currently active branch
git branch

# Create a new branch at the current commit
git branch [branch-name]

# Switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
git checkout [branch]

# Merge the specified branch’s history into the current one
git merge [branch]

# Show all commits in the current branch’s history
git log





## SHARE & UPDATE
# Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos
# Add a git URL as an alias
git remote add [alias] [url]

# Fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
git fetch [alias]

# Merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
git merge [alias]/[branch]

# Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
git push [alias] [branch]

# Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
git pull





## TRACKING PATH CHANGES
# Versioning file removes and path changes
# Delete the file from the project and stage the removal for commit
git rm [file]

# Change an existing file path and stage the move
git mv [existing-path] [new-path]

# Show all commit logs with an indication of any paths that moved
git log --stat -M





## TEMPORARY COMMITS
# Temporarily store modified, tracked files to change branches
# Save modified and staged changes
git stash

# List stack-order of stashed file changes
git stash list

# Write working from the top of the stash stack
git stash pop

# Discard the changes from the top of the stash stack
git stash drop





## REWRITE HISTORY
# Rewriting branches, updating commits, and clearing history
# Apply any commits of the current branch ahead of the specified one
git rebase [branch]

# Clear staging area, rewrite working tree from the specified commit
git reset --hard [commit]





## INSPECT & COMPARE
# Examining logs, diffs, and object information
# Show the commit history for the currently active branch
git log

# Show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB
git log branchB..branchA

# Show the commits that changed the file, even across renames
git log --follow [file]

# Show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB
git diff branchB...branchA

# Show any object in Git in human-readable format
git show [SHA]





## IGNORING PATTERNS
# Preventing unintentional staging or committing of files
# System-wide ignore pattern for all local repositories
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]

# Save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string
# matches or wildcard globs.
# Example:
# logs/
# *.notes
# pattern*/
