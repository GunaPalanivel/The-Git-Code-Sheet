# IGNORING PATTERNS

## Preventing unintentional staging or committing of files

## System-wide ignore pattern for all local repositories

```
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```

## Save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string

matches or wildcard globs.

```
logs/
```

```
*.notes
```

```
